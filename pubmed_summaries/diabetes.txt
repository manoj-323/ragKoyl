Obesity is a major global health challenge, contributing to metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension. The increasing prevalence of obesity, driven by sedentary lifestyles, poor dietary habits, and genetic predisposition, underscores the urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies. Conventional pharmacological treatments, including appetite suppressants and metabolic modulators, often fail to provide sustainable weight loss due to side effects, poor adherence, and limited long-term efficacy. As a result, natural bioactive compounds have gained attention for their anti-obesity potential. However, their clinical application is hindered by poor bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and inefficient delivery. Lipid-based nano-carriers, including liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers, offer a promising solution by enhancing the solubility, stability, and targeted delivery of these compounds. These advanced delivery systems improve bioactive retention, enable controlled release, and enhance therapeutic action on adipose tissue and metabolic pathways. Additionally, functionalized and stimulus-responsive nanocarriers present innovative approaches for precision obesity treatment. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in large-scale production, regulatory approval, and long-term safety. Overcoming these barriers is critical to ensuring the successful clinical translation of nano-formulated therapies. This review explores the potential of lipid-based nano-carriers in optimizing the therapeutic efficacy of natural anti-obesity compounds and highlights their role in advancing next-generation obesity management strategies.

The coexistence of dermatomyositis (DM)/clinically amyopathic DM (CADM) and psoriasis has been infrequently documented in the literature. Consequently, this study aimed to analyze this entity from our tertiary center and review the relevant literature.
This retrospective observational cross-sectional study and case series included patients with DM/CADM and psoriasis between 1998 and 2024. A literature review was also conducted.
Nine of 331 patients with DM (n = 265)/CADM (n = 66) had psoriasis; six were female, and all were of white ethnicity. The median age at DM diagnosis was 38 years (range: 18-78), and at psoriasis diagnosis was 43 years (range: 18-81), with a median interval of four years between diagnoses. The follow-up revealed that six patients were discharged, two died, and one continued follow-up. The primary comorbidities included systemic arterial hypertension (n = 3) and diabetes mellitus (n = 3). Four patients presented with varicella zoster (n = 1) or pulmonary tuberculosis (n = 3). Regarding the literature review, 15 articles reported a total of 17 cases of overlapping DM/CADM and psoriasis. However, variability was observed in the DM/CADM diagnostic criteria. The mean age at DM diagnosis in the literature was 32.3 years (range: 2-59), whereas for psoriasis, it was 31 (7-63) years. Female patients were predominant.
This investigation identified the coexistence of DMPs, with a median age of 38 years for DM and 43 years for psoriasis. The variability in the diagnostic criteria underscores the necessity for standardized approaches to enhance patient management.

Plant-based diets are gaining popularity due to their well-documented cardiometabolic benefits and environmental sustainability. However, these diets are often lower in specific micronutrients such as iodine, raising concerns about their potential impact on thyroid health. Therefore, we examined the associations between plant-based diets and the risk of hypothyroidism.
We analysed data from the UK (United Kingdom) Biobank cohort. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for incident hypothyroidism across vegans, vegetarians, pescatarians, poultry-eaters, low meat-eaters, and high meat-eaters aged 40-69 years. Ancillary to this, we carried out logistic regression analyses to evaluate associations between the diet groups and prevalent hypothyroidism according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes at baseline.
We included 466,362 individuals from the UK Biobank, of which 220,514 followed a high meat, 221,554 a low meat, 5242 a poultry-based, 10,598 a pescatarian, 8057 a vegetarian, and 397 a vegan diet. During a median SD (Standard Deviation) follow-up of 12.7 (± 3.2) years, 10,831 participants developed hypothyroidism. In multivariable Cox regression models without adjustment for body mass index (BMI), none of the diets were significantly associated with the risk of hypothyroidism. However, there was a tendency for a higher risk of hypothyroidism among vegetarians compared to people following a high meat diet (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.98-1.30). After controlling for BMI, a potential collider, the association for vegetarians (HR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.07-1.42) became stronger and statistically significant. Furthermore, we observed a positive association between low meat-eaters (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.08), poultry-eaters (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.28), pescatarians (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.19) and vegetarian (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.15-1.38) with hypothyroidism prevalence.
In the present study, we found a moderately higher risk of hypothyroidism among vegetarians, after controlling for BMI, a potential collider. This slightly higher risk of hypothyroidism among vegetarians requires further investigation, taking iodine status and thyroid hormone levels into account.

Obesity is recognized as a significant health challenge in Africa, contributing to the double burden of malnutrition and elevating the risks of diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Existing studies on the Obesity Kuznets Curve (OKC) assessment overlook Africa's unique socio-economic and gender-specific dynamics. In light of the claim that different socioeconomic characteristics significantly influence the prevalence of obesity in different nations, this study examines the nonlinear relationship between economic growth and each of the obesity prevalence in males, females, and both sexes, respectively, while accounting for the effects of urbanization, trade, and food production.
The study employs a panel data design to analyse the OKC hypothesis in a multivariate non-linear framework. The study focusses on Africa, with the study units consisting of African countries analysed within the framework of regional groupings and differentiated by obesity prevalence in males, females and both sexes correspondingly. Specifically, the study utilised panel data of 45 African nations sub-panelled into Eastern, Western, Central and Southern regions during the period from 2000 to 2020. The primary outcome variable is obesity prevalence, while the key exposure variable is economic growth. The study also considers trade openness, urbanization and food production as additional covariates influencing obesity prevalence to provide a nuanced analysis. Considering the existence of residual cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity issue in the panel data, we applied the novel Biased Comment Method of Method estimator using the dynamic fixed-effect model as the main method to ensure robust and reliable estimates. This novel approach allows the study to address unobserved heterogeneity and interdependencies across regional economies.
The principal findings demonstrated a distinct pattern of the OKC (non-linear relationship between the country's economic growth and obesity) when analysing prevalence of obesity in both sexes collectively and also when considering obesity prevalence in males and females separately across the geographical panels used. The results further showed that trade openness is positively associated with obesity prevalence in males and females separately together with both sexes collectively across all regional classifications. However, the effect of urbanization, and food production on obesity prevalence in males, obesity prevalence in females and obesity prevalence in both sexes correspondingly varied across the regional classifications.
Our analysis leads to specific policy recommendations, including the development of robust, regionally tailored health policies aimed at preventing obesity across Africa. These include promoting healthy diets through subsidies on nutritious foods, regulating trade polices to limit unhealthy food imports and integrating urban planning to encourage active lifestyles. Considering the rapid economic expansion, urbanization, trade liberalization and food production in many African nation, these strategies ought to address regional and gender-specific dynamics while aligning with global development goals such as SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and SDG2 (zero hunger), to effectively mitigate the rising prevalence of obesity.

The close interplay between metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and type 2 diabetes supports the need to identify beneficial combination therapies of antidiabetic medications targeted for the treatment of MASLD. This study aimed to investigate the complementary effects of combination therapy with pioglitazone (PIO) and empagliflozin (EMPA) on MASLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes.
In a randomized, open-label trial, 50 participants with type 2 diabetes and MASLD were assigned 1:1:1 to receive PIO 15 mg, EMPA 10 mg, or a combination (PIO 15 mg plus EMPA 10 mg) daily for 24 weeks. Liver fat fraction and stiffness were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), respectively.
Combination therapy resulted in the largest reduction in liver fat and stiffness among treatment groups. Participants experiencing a relative reduction ≥ 30% or an absolute reduction ≥ 5% in liver fat were the most prevalent in the combination group (100.0% vs. 57.1% in PIO and 87.5% in EMPA, p = 0.010). In addition, the combination group showed the highest proportion of individuals with a relative reduction ≥ 30% in liver fat and ≥ 20% in liver stiffness than the monotherapy groups (50.0% vs. 21.4% in PIO and 6.3% in EMPA, p = 0.029). Combination therapy did not induce the changes in subcutaneous fat deposition observed in the monotherapy groups, but it did show the most substantial reduction in visceral fat, concurrently showing the largest increase in adiponectin level across the three groups (p = 0.036).
Combination therapy of PIO with EMPA showed synergistic benefits for MASLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes, compensating for the inadequate or unfavorable effects of monotherapies; ClincialTrials.gov number, NCT03646292.
The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number: NCT03646292).

The objective is to systematically gather relevant research to determine and quantify the risk factors and pooled prevalence for pneumonia after a radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer.
The reporting procedures of this meta-analysis conformed to the PRISMA 2020. Chinese Wan Fang data, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Periodical Full-text Database (VIP), Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from inception to January 20, 2024, were systematically searched for cohort or case-control studies that reported particular risk factors for pneumonia after radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The pooled prevalence of pneumonia was estimated alongside risk factor analysis. The quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale after the chosen studies had been screened and the data retrieved. RevMan 5.4 and R 4.4.2 were the program used to perform the meta-analysis.
Our study included data from 20,840 individuals across 27 trials. The pooled prevalence of postoperative pneumonia was 11.0% (95% CI = 8.0% ~ 15.0%). Fifteen risk factors were statistically significant, according to pooled analyses. Several factors were identified to be strong risk factors, including smoking history (OR 2.71, 95% CI = 2.09 ~ 3.50, I2= 26%), prolonged postoperative nasogastric tube retention (OR 2.25, 95% CI = 1.36-3.72, I2= 63%), intraoperative bleeding ≥ 200 ml (OR 2.21, 95% CI = 1.15-4.24, I2= 79%), diabetes mellitus (OR 4.58, 95% CI = 1.84-11.38, I2= 96%), male gender (OR 3.56, 95% CI = 1.50-8.42, I2= 0%), total gastrectomy (OR 2.59, 95% CI = 1.83-3.66, I2= 0%), COPD (OR 4.72, 95% CI = 3.80-5.86, I2= 0%), impaired respiratory function (OR 2.72, 95% CI = 1.58-4.69, I2= 92%), D2 lymphadenectomy (OR 4.14, 95% CI = 2.29-7.49, I2= 0%), perioperative blood transfusion (OR 4.21, 95% CI = 2.51-7.06, I2= 90%), and hypertension (OR 2.21, 95% CI = 1.29-3.79, I2= 0%). Moderate risk factors included excessive surgery duration (OR 1.51, 95% CI = 1.25-1.83, I2= 90%), advanced age (OR 1.91, 95% CI = 1.42-2.58, I2= 94%), nutritional status (OR 2.62, 95% CI = 1.55-4.44, I2= 71%), and history of pulmonary disease (OR 1.61, 95% CI = 1.17-2.21, I2= 79%).
This study identified 15 independent risk factors significantly associated with pneumonia after radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer, with a pooled prevalence of 11.0%. These findings emphasize the importance of targeted preventive strategies, including preoperative smoking cessation, nutritional interventions, blood glucose and blood pressure control, perioperative respiratory training, minimizing nasogastric tube retention time, and optimizing perioperative blood transfusion strategies. For high-risk patients, such as the elderly, those undergoing prolonged surgeries, experiencing excessive intraoperative blood loss, undergoing total gastrectomy, or receiving open surgery, close postoperative monitoring is essential. Early recognition of pneumonia signs and timely intervention can improve patient outcomes and reduce complications.

This study aimed to explore the effects of hypoglycemic agents with weight loss effect plus a high protein diet and moderate exercise on weight loss and diabetes remission in adults with obesity and newly diagnosed prediabetes/type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Participants with obesity and newly diagnosed prediabetes or T2D (n = 61) were randomly allocated to standard treatment group (conventional medication and lifestyle guidance for 12 months) and intensive treatment group (in addition to conventional medication, a high protein diet and moderate exercise were given for 12 months).
By month 12, 60 (98.4%) participants completed the 12-month follow-up visit. In the intensive treatment group, 73.33% patients in the prediabetes subgroup returned to normoglycemia and the diabetes remission rate was 86.67% in the diabetes subgroup, which were much higher than the remission rate of prediabetes subgroup (7.69%) and diabetes subgroup (16.67%) in the standard treatment group (P < 0.001). The mean weight change was - 19.29 kg (95% CI, - 22.95 to - 15.63) in the intensive treatment group and - 1.52 kg (95% CI, - 5.12 to 2.07) in the standard treatment group from baseline after intervention. The weight change between the two groups was significantly different (net difference, - 17.77 kg; 95% CI, - 22.90 to - 12.64; P < 0.001). Percent of body fat, visceral fat area, and hepatic controlled attenuation parameter value reduced significantly in the intensive treatment group compared to the standard treatment group (P < 0.001).
Hypoglycemic agents with weight loss effect plus a high protein diet and moderate exercise could lead to a considerable proportion of patients with diabetes achieving diabetes remission.

Ultra-processed food (UPF) contributes to nearly 50% of Canadians' diets. Research in other countries has begun to implicate high intakes of UPFs and negative health outcomes, including body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, and unfavourable lipid profiles. There have been no population level examinations of the relationship between UPF consumption and cardiometabolic risk in Canada.
Drawing on the Canadian Health Measures Survey (2016/17 and 2018/19), this study investigates the relationship between UPF consumption and cardiometabolic risk factors among Canadians (ages 19-79, n = 6517). Dietary data collected by Food Frequency Questionnaire was classified as UPF or not using the NOVA classification system which scores foods by degree of processing. Participants were grouped into quartiles based on the daily servings of UPF. Sociodemographic and lifestyle variables were collected via household questionnaire and cardiometabolic outcomes were measured during a clinic visit. Multivariable linear regression analyses separately assessed the association between cardiometabolic risk factors and UPF quartiles while adjusting for various sociodemographic and lifestyle variables. Sensitivity analyses additionally adjusted for fruit and vegetable intake (servings/day) to determine the effect of diet quality on this relationship. All analyses were weighted to ensure national representativeness.
UPF servings per day ranged from 1.2 in the lowest and 5.8 in the highest quartile. Compared to the lowest quartiles of UPF consumption, those in the highest were more likely to be male, in the lowest income quartile, Black or White, have lower household education, and higher physical activity and sedentary time. After adjustments, UPF consumption was positively associated with BMI, WC, diastolic BP, HBA1C, c-reactive protein, white blood cells (WBC), fasting triglycerides (TG), and fasting insulin. Fruit and vegetable intake attenuated the association for all outcomes, while BMI, WC, WBC, and TG remained significantly associated with increased UPF consumption.
This study is the first Canadian study looking at population level intakes of UPF across various cardiometabolic risk factors and adds to the growing body of literature demonstrating the detrimental health effects associated with UPF consumption.

Traumatic injuries among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are associated with extended hospital stays and higher mortality rates.
This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of DM among traumatic patients admitted to Aseer Central Hospital, Aseer Region, Saudi Arabia.
A cross-sectional design was conducted among trauma casualties aged 18 years and older admitted to the Trauma Center of Asser Central Hospital, Abha, Saudi Arabia, for six months from July 1 to December 31, 2024. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire covered various aspects, including demographic information, smoking status, presence of chronic diseases, previous diabetes diagnoses, details of any accidents, diabetes diagnosis during the accident, and self-care practices.
Three hundred and eleven trauma casualties were included with a mean age of 46.7 ± 12.9. Of them, 60.8% were men. The study found that the prevalence of diabetes among trauma casualties was 8.7%, with 48.2% incidentally discovered during the current trauma. Among diagnosed patients, 33.3% had glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels between 7.51-8.5%, 11.1% between 8.51-9.5%, and 22.2% exceeded 9.5%. The predictors of diabetes diagnosis included smoking (OR = 6.39, 95% CI = 2.08-19.63), lower levels of education levels (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.58-0.96), and a positive family history (OR = 24.9, CI = 7.96-78.36).
The study found an 8.7% prevalence of diabetes among trauma casualties, with nearly half discovered during the event. Factors like smoking, education, and family history of diabetes were associated with diagnosis. Routine diabetes screening is crucial for early detection and management. Targeted interventions, such as multidisciplinary care teams and telemedicine, can improve diabetes management. Further research is needed to address cultural and socioeconomic factors.

To verify the influence of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) on renal function parameters in type 2 diabetes based on well-known randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Embase, and grey literature were searched for RCTs published until December 24, 2024. The quality of the RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for continuous variables using meta-analysis. The primary outcomes were composite renal function parameters, including serum creatinine (Cr) levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin excretion (UAE), and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR).
Pooled data from 24 studies revealed that GLP-1 RA positively influenced renal outcomes in the type 2 diabetes group to some extent compared with that in the control group. GLP- 1 RA decreased serum creatinine levels (WMD=-0.10, 95%CI -0.19 to -0.01, I2= 33%, P < 0.05), eGFR(WMD = 0.54, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.90, I2= 27%, P < 0.05), UAE (WMD=-11.92, 95% CI - 23.50 to - 0.33, I2= 0%, P < 0.05) and UACR (WMD: -1.01 mg/g, 95% CI:-1.68, -0.34, I2= 15%, P < 0.05) in the type 2 diabetes group.
GLP-1 RA treatment significantly elevated eGFR, decreased the UACR, and positively influenced renal function outcomes in the type 2 diabetes group.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem. This study aimed to evaluate the complex relationship of CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk with mortality in different age groups and the mediation effect of CVD risk among Chinese adults.
A total of 7533 participants from the 2009 wave of China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) cohort were included in this study and followed up to 2015. CKD was defined as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73m2. Framingham risk score (FRS) was used to assess CVD risk. The interaction, joint association of CVD risk and CKD on mortality, and subsequent mediation effect were evaluated using multivariable Cox regression.
CHNS cohort recorded 266 deaths over a mean follow-up time of 5.04 years. The all-mortality rates among adults with CKD and high CVD risk were significantly higher than healthy controls (22.48 and 21.30 per 1000 person-years). After adjusting for covariates of age, gender, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, hyperuricemia, smoking status, and alcohol consumption, the adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of CKD and high CVD risk were 1.70 (95% CI 1.27-2.28) and 1.62 (95%CI 1.26-2.09), respectively. Joint effect analysis revealed that mortality hazard was highest in CKD patients with high CVD risk (aHR = 3.15, 95% CI 1.92-5.16). Mediation analysis showed that significant partial mediation by SBP and fasting glucose, accounting for 19.2% (p < 0.001) and 3.52% (p = 0.012) of the total effect of CKD on mortality.
Comprehensive strategies including lifestyle modifications, diet restrictions, and cardio-nephrology multidisciplinary treatment for mitigating CVD risk in CKD patients should focus on middle-aged people and early disease detection.

Gingival recession (GR) is a common oral health condition characterized by the exposure of the tooth's root which affects diverse populations worldwide. Thus, this study aimed to analyze data from adult dental patients at the outpatient clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry, Ain Shams University, to assess the prevalence of GR among Egyptian adults and to identify associated risk factors and clinical characteristics.
This study was a cross-sectional study that included 3773 individuals to detect the prevalence, risk factors and clinical characteristics of GR. All participants were examined for presence of GR, and their demographic data was collected by electronic form, while only participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were then subjected to a full professional periodontal examination. GR was categorized following the 2018 World Workshop Cairo classification system (RT1, RT2, RT3). The statistical tests used were Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post hoc with Bonferroni correction, as well as Fisher's exact test followed by pairwise comparisons using multiple z-tests with Bonferroni correction.
Out of 3773 participants only 901 subjects had GR with a prevalence of 23.88%. The prevalence of localized recession (63.93%) was higher than generalized recession (36.07%) with RT1 (43.8%) being the most prevalent followed by RT2 (37.29%), and RT3 (18.87%). The most affected teeth were lower anterior teeth (46.53%) followed by upper left premolars (13.02%), then upper right premolars (11.11%), and upper anterior teeth (10.76%). The prevalence of GR was higher in males (59.6%) more than in females (40.4%), and in smokers (61.49%) more than non-smokers (38.51%). The most common medical conditions were diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Higher severity of the GR was associated with males, middle aged and old age, periodontal diseases, higher plaque and bleeding scores, medical conditions, smoking, and uneducated patients.
The prevalence of GR in Egyptians is 23.88% with the most prevalent class of was RT1. Higher severity of the GR was associated with periodontal diseases, higher plaque and bleeding scores, presence of underlying medical conditions and smoking suggesting that regular dental assessments as well as dentists' awareness of the prevention, and treatment of GR has to be increased.

Short-term intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation is a common complication following intravitreal injection (IVI) of anti-VEGF drugs, potentially posing risks to retinal health. This study aimed to identify key factors influencing short-term IOP elevation and provide actionable insights for its prediction and effective management in clinical practice.
An observational study was conducted on 64 postoperative measurements from patients who underwent IVI of anti-VEGF drugs at Yidu Central Hospital of Weifang between 2023 and 2024. Data on patient demographics (e.g., age, sex), clinical characteristics (e.g., lens status, diabetes), and pre- and postoperative IOP values were collected. A linear mixed-effects model was applied to evaluate factors associated with IOP elevation 5 min post-injection.
The baseline IOP was 14.64 ± 2.71 mmHg, increasing to 43.33 ± 7.70 mmHg at 5 min post-injection and subsequently decreasing to 19.25 ± 3.80 mmHg at 30 min post-injection. Statistically significant differences were observed between the baseline and postoperative IOP values (p < 0.0001). At 30 min post-injection, 68.8% of the measured IOP values were ≤ 21 mmHg, and all were ≤ 30 mmHg. The linear mixed-effects model revealed that older age (p < 0.001), native crystalline lens (p < 0.001), and diabetes (p = 0.009) were significant predictors of greater IOP elevation at 5 min post-injection.
Short-term IOP elevation following intravitreal anti-VEGF injections is associated with older age, a native crystalline lens, and diabetes. Individualized preventive strategies may effectively mitigate the risk of postoperative IOP elevation in high-risk patients.

Vaccine hesitancy (VH) and vaccine refusal are increasing globally, posing a significant challenge to public health. This study aimed to evaluate VH and associated factors in parents of children with different chronic conditions, comparing them to a control group of healthy children.
This cross-sectional study included mothers of children aged 6 to 12 years, diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), congenital heart disease (CHD), congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) and healthy children without chronic diseases. The study collected sociodemographic data, and parents completed the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) survey and the Parental Attitude Research Instrument (PARI). Vaccine hesitancy was defined as a PACV score ≥ 50.
A total of 1163 participants were included, consisting of 546 children with chronic conditions. The overall VH rate was %14.7. Compared to control group, parents of children with T1DM had 3.3 times higher odds of VH, and parents of children with ASD had 1.8 times higher odds of VH. However, parents of children with CHD had lower odds of VH [OR: 0.38 (95% CI: 0.15-0.97)]. The most common reasons for VH were concerns about vaccine ingredients (40.2%) and fear of adverse events (22.5%). The primary suggested solution was receiving more information from healthcare professionals (33.3%). Factors such as having a child with a chronic condition, personal experience with vaccine adverse events, and reliance on the internet for vaccine information were associated with increased VH, whereas obtaining information from healthcare professionals was linked to lower VH. Higher parental democratic attitudes were associated with lower VH, while increased marital conflict was linked to higher VH.
Addressing both informational gaps and psychosocial factors, such as marital conflict and democratic parenting attitudes, can enhance vaccine acceptance. Healthcare professionals should provide personalized guidance and resources to empower parents, enabling them to make informed vaccination decisions for high-risk groups such as children with chronic conditions.

Human genetics is an important tool for identifying genes as potential drug targets, and the extensive genetic study of cardiovascular disease provides an opportunity to leverage genetics to match specific patient populations to specific drug targets to improve prioritization of patient selection for clinical studies.
We selected well described genetic variants in the region of PCSK9 (rs11591147 and rs562556), ADRB1 (rs7076938), ACE (rs4968782 and rs4363), GLP1R (rs10305492) and ABCC8 (rs757110) for use as proxies for the effects of drugs. Time-to-event analyses were utilized to evaluate their effects on atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) death and/or re-hospitalization using real-world longitudinal dataset. To mitigate the effect of confounding factors for cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, we employed propensity score matching.
After matching, a genetic proxy for PCSK9 inhibition (rs11591147) improved survival from CV death/heart transplant in individuals following a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.78, P = 0.03). A genetic proxy for beta-blockade (rs7076938) improved freedom from rehospitalization or death in individuals with AF (HR 0.92, P = 0.001), and a genetic proxy of ACE inhibition (rs7076938) improved freedom from rehospitalization for HF or death (HR 0.8, P = 0.017) and AF (HR 0.85, P = 0.0014). A protective variant in GLP1R (rs10305492) showed decreased risk of developing HF or CV death after diagnosis of ischemic heart disease (HR = 0.82, P = 0.031) and a protective variant in ABCC8 (rs757110) showed decreased risk of CV mortality since ischemic disease diagnosis (HR = 0.88, P = 0.04) and decreased risk of AF in diabetic patients with ischemic heart disease (HR = 0.68, P = 0.001). Notably, despite smaller cohort sizes after matching, we often observed numerically smaller HRs and reduced P, indicating more pronounced effects and increased statistical association. However, not all genetic proxies replicated known treatment effects.
Genetic proxies for well-known drugs corroborate findings from clinical trials in cardiovascular disease. Our results demonstrate a useful analytical approach that leverages genetic evidence from a large cohort with longitudinal outcomes data to effectively select patient populations where specific drug targets may be most effective.

To analyze the gut bacterial microbiome in rats with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) compared to normal rats.
Type 2 diabetes was induced in rats via a high-fat and high-sugar diet combined with a low dose of streptozotocin. Glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity were evaluated using intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests. The progression of peripheral neuropathy was assessed using the mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency. Histopathological analysis of rat colon tissues was performed using hematoxylin-eosin staining to observe morphological changes. The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β in spinal cord tissues were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Fecal samples were then collected for metagenomic sequencing and analysis.
Behavioral tests revealed reduced mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency in PDN rats. Histological analysis showed significant colonic mucosal damage and inflammatory cell infiltration, suggesting impaired intestinal barrier function. Elevated TNF-α and IL-1β levels in spinal cord tissues further highlight peripheral inflammation's role in PDN. Sequencing analysis revealed significant differences in gut microbiota composition between PDN and control rats, with altered Bacillota/Bacteroidota ratios and increased Lactobacillus abundance. Functional annotation analysis, based on the KEGG, EggNOG, and CAZy databases, indicated significant enrichment of metabolic pathways related to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and cell structure biogenesis in PDN rats. Cluster analysis identified higher functional clustering in Metabolism and Genetic Information Processing pathways in PDN rats.
This study demonstrates that PDN leads to altered gut microbiota composition, disrupted metabolic pathways, and increased inflammation, contributing to the pathological progression of diabetic neuropathy. This study provides new insights into the interplay between gut microbiota and diabetic neuropathy, offering potential avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting microbiome and metabolism.

To investigate the risk factors associated with recurrent hemorrhage following vitrectomy surgical intervention for diabetic retinopathy (DR).
A retrospective analysis was conducted on 579 eyes diagnosed with DR necessitating surgical intervention. These cases were categorized into two groups: recurrent hemorrhage and non-recurrent hemorrhage. Comparative, random forest (RF), and regression analyses were subsequently performed to evaluate variables pertaining to patients' demographic information, clinical examination and blood test results, treatment approaches, lifestyle habits, and overall health status.
This study compared patients with recurrent and non-recurrent hemorrhages, revealing significant differences in factors such as endodiathermy, anticoagulant use, cerebrovascular diseases, smoking status, glycosylated hemoglobin levels and BMI. Patients with no recurrent hemorrhage have faster vision recovery. The univariable logistic regression analysis indicated that cerebrovascular disease (OR = 7.87, P < 0.001), anticoagulant use (OR = 16.72, P < 0.001), and elevated glycated hemoglobin levels (OR = 21.22, P < 0.001) exhibited strong associations with recurrent hemorrhage. The multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that recurrent hemorrhage risk factors include anticoagulant use (OR = 120.77, P = 0.020) and glycated hemoglobin levels (OR = 18.41, P = 0.001).
Recurrent postoperative hemorrhage is influenced by several factors, notably the use of intraoperative endodiathermy, adjustments in ocular therapy, and management of the patient's systemic condition. In clinical practice, careful consideration of these factors is essential to mitigate postoperative hemorrhage in patients.

Deregulation of amino acid (AA) metabolism has been reported in several pathological conditions, including metabolic diseases (e.g., obesity and diabetes), cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. However, the role of alterations in AA levels in chronic liver disorders such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) remains largely unexplored. In this study we aimed to evaluate the hepatic AA composition in patients with different stages of MASLD, and their relationship with MASLD-related risk factors. A case-control study was conducted in 40 patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery at Virgen de la Arrixaca University Hospital (Murcia, Spain), where MASLD diagnosis was confirmed by histological analysis of liver biopsies, and hepatic AA levels were measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Our results revealed that the hepatic AA profile was significantly altered in patients with MASLD. More specifically, comparison between MASLD patients revealed a significant increase in hepatic levels of arginine, glycine and cystine in MASH samples compared to steatotic livers. In addition, hepatic concentrations of arginine, lysine and cystine positively correlated with histopathological diagnosis and other MASLD-related parameters, including transaminases and CK-18 levels. These findings suggest that alterations in certain hepatic AA levels such as arginine, lysine, glycine and cystine in MASLD patients could have translational relevance in understanding the onset of this disease.

Biochemical tests are required for diagnosing GH-deficiency in children and adults, but controversies remain regarding diagnostic criteria and type of biochemical tests. The aim of the study is to map the clinical practices of GHD diagnosis in children and adults.
The Growth Hormone Research Society members initiated a Delphi survey of the diagnosis of GHD in children and adults. Pediatric (n = 18) and adult (n = 25) endocrinologists from 14 countries participated and rated their extent of agreement with 61 statements using a Likert-type-scale (1-7). Consensus was predefined as ≥ 80% of panelists rating their agreement unidirectionally as either ≥ 5 (agreement) or ≤ 3 (disagreement).
The pediatric panel reached consensus on 17 of 29 (59%) statements on diagnosis in children, whereas the adult panel reached consensus on 28 of 32 (88%) statements on adult patients. There was general agreement to test for GHD in an appropriate clinical context and also on the timing of testing for GHD in both children and adults. A subnormal IGF-I level was considered diagnostic in both children and adults with panhypopituitarism. In children, there was consensus to recommend the arginine stimulation test and the glucagon test. The insulin tolerance test (ITT) was considered gold standard in adults and there was also consensus to recommend the macimorelin test. A stimulated GH cut-off < 5μg/l was consistent with severe GHD in children, whereas test-specific cut-offs were recommended in adults.
Consensus on the GHD diagnosis was lower in pediatric practice, mainly with respect to choice and interpretation of GH stimulation tests.

Erectile dysfunction is a prevalent condition that may impact psychosocial health and quality of life. While various treatment modalities exist, penile prosthesis implantation offers a permanent solution. Surgery, however, carries inherent risks and potential complications. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors of early postoperative complications after penile prosthesis surgery in a large, multicenter, prospective, cohort study. Data was analyzed from patients participating in the PHOENIX registry, an international study on penile prosthesis surgery conducted by the EAU Research Foundation. Patients were operated on from November 2021 until august 2024 in 30 centers from 8 countries. Our study was not limited to one device or brand, all available inflatable and malleable devices were eligible for inclusion. Postoperative complications were registered at different time points, up to 2 years post-surgery. For this analysis we studied complications that occurred within 2 weeks after surgery. Data on early complications after penile prosthesis surgery of 1072 patients were analyzed. Median age was 62 (range 24-88) years old at time of surgery. A total of 639 (59.6%) patients received a drain perioperatively. A total of 49 patients (4.6%) reported complications within 2 weeks after surgery. Infection occurred in 4 patients and penoscrotal hematoma occurred in 6 patients within 2 weeks post-surgery. A total of 5 patients underwent early revision surgery. There was no significant effect of diabetes mellitus on development of an early postoperative infection (0.4% vs. 0.4%, p = 1.00). We found no significant impact of drain placement on hematoma development (0.3% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.69). We did find that early hematoma occurred more frequently in low-volume versus high-volume centers (1.3% vs. 0.1%, p = 0.02). This large international study confirms that penile prosthesis surgery is a safe procedure with a low rate of early postoperative complications.
