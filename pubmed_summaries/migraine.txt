We have previously shown headache to be highly prevalent in Delhi and National Capital Region of northern India, as we did earlier in Karnataka State in the south. Here we present a complementary study performed contemporaneously of headache-attributed burden, along with a population health-care needs assessment.
In a cross-sectional study using the standardised methodology of the Global Campaign against Headache, we randomly selected households, and one member aged 18-65 years from each, making unannounced visits. Trained interviewers used the HARDSHIP questionnaire incorporating enquiry into various aspects of headache-attributed burden: symptom burden, lost health, impaired participation in daily activities, quality of life (QoL) and willingness to pay (WTP) for treatment. Enquiry included questions about headache yesterday (HY).
Of N = 2,066, participants reporting headache in the past year spent 9.5% of their time with headache of moderate intensity (1.8 on the scale of 1-3). Population-level estimates of all time spent with headache were in the range 5.5-6.6%. On this measure, migraine (8.2%) was, at individual level, much more burdensome than tension-type headache (TTH) (1.7%), and females with migraine or TTH were more burdened (8.7% and 2.0% respectively) than males (6.0% and 1.0%). Migraine accounted for substantial health loss (3.6%) at individual level (disability weights from the Global Burden of Disease study factored in), but both measures of overall burden (QoL and WTP) found it greatest among those with probable medication-overuse headache (pMOH) or other causes of headache on ≥ 15 days/month (H15+), with TTH least. For all headache types, participation was more impaired in household than in paid work, the latter being little affected (overall, males 0.3 lost days/month, females 0.1). Impaired participation in social or leisure activities was close to unmeasurably low. Impaired participation from HY was 1.8% across all domains of activity. One quarter (26%) of the population aged 18-65 years would be expected to benefit from health care, meeting our criteria for need: 16.1% with migraine, 6.4% with H15+.
Headache disorders in northern India are not only prevalent but also associated with high burden. One quarter of the adult population would benefit from professional headache care.

People with migraine may prefer over-the-counter (OTC) drugs because of multiple reasons, but their overuse can cause medication overuse headaches. This analysis of the ObserVational survey of the Epidemiology, tReatment, and Care Of MigrainE (OVERCOME [Japan]) 2nd study describes the real-world use of OTC headache drugs and the challenges that potentially prevent people with migraine from accessing appropriate medical management in Japan.
This analysis of the cross-sectional, population-based, nationwide online survey included adults with migraine. Respondents reported their experiences with prescription and OTC drugs for migraine, migraine-specific drug awareness, and attitude towards migraine. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the number of monthly headache days (MHD) and the frequency of OTC drug use/month.
The 19,590 respondents with migraine (68.8% female; mean [SD] age 40.5 [13.1] years) had mean (SD) 3.5 (5.2) MHDs; 29.0% consulted doctors in the past year for migraine. OTC drug use in the past year was common (≥ 62.1%) regardless of doctor consultation or number of MHDs. Among respondents who answered that they would usually use prescribed drugs when they have a migraine attack, 35.2% reported that they would typically use OTC drugs too. The frequency of OTC drug use was the same or higher than that of prescribed drugs in 51.3% of the respondents who consulted doctors in the past year. Only 14.6% of respondents discussed OTC drugs with doctors during consultations in the past year. Migraine-specific drug access and awareness were limited even among frequent OTC drug users (≥ 10 days/month); 18.2% used triptans, but 65.5% never heard of it. Among 37.1% of respondents who had hesitated to visit a doctor, 'I could handle it myself with OTC medicine' was the most common reason for hesitation (34.9%).
OTC drug use is common among people with migraine; however, it is not frequently discussed with doctors. Many respondents, even those with frequent OTC drug use, did not have access or awareness of migraine-specific drugs. To prevent medication overuse for migraine, the use of OTC drugs should also be discussed and managed.

We evaluated the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of eptinezumab in preventing high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM) and chronic migraine (CM) over 24 weeks in real-world. We also assessed its impact during the first treatment week, in patients failing monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (anti-CGRP mAbs), and the effects of dose escalation to 300 mg in patients requiring enhanced control.
EMBRACE II is a multicenter (n = 22), prospective, 24-week, real-world study involving consecutive patients with HFEM or CM who had failed > 3 preventive treatments. Eptinezumab (100 mg, with the option for escalation to 300 mg at week 12) was administered quarterly.
change in monthly migraine days (MMD), for HFEM or monthly headache days (MHD), for CM, between weeks 21-24 and baseline. Secondary endpoints: changes in monthly analgesic intake (MAI), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS), Migraine Interictal Burden Scale (MIBS-4), and responder rates.
Of the 215 participants who had received ≥ 1 eptinezumab dose, 74 were treated for ≥ 24 weeks and considered for effectiveness analysis. Eptinezumab significantly (p < 0.001) reduced MMD/MHD (- 10.5), MAI (- 15.6), NRS (- 2.2), HIT-6 (- 9.9), MIDAS (- 48.7), and MIBS-4 (- 4.3). ≥ 50% responders were 69%, ≥ 75% responders 39.2%, and 100% responders 4.1%. Comparing the first week with the last baseline week, a significant reduction in migraine days was observed (- 3.7; p < 0.001). Significant improvements were seen in patients failing anti-CGRP mAbs (32.4%) and in those escalating to 300 mg (33.8%). Half of the subjects reported being "very much improved" or "much improved". The adverse events were infrequent (2.8%).
This real-world study documents that 24-week eptinezumab treatment is rapidly effective and well tolerated in migraine patients with multiple therapeutic failures (including anti-CGRP mAbs). One-third of patients escalated to 300 mg at week 12, achieving further significant migraine-related disability reduction.

This study systematically evaluates and meta-analyzes Mendelian randomization studies on the bidirectional causal relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and systemic diseases. We searched five databases, assessed study quality, and extracted data. Diseases were classified using ICD-11, and the meta-analysis was performed with RevMan 5.4. A total of 56 studies identified genetic links between AD susceptibility and systemic diseases. Notably, genetic proxies for hip osteoarthritis (OR = 0.80;p= 0.007) and rheumatoid arthritis (OR = 0.97;p= 0.004) were inversely associated with AD risk, while gout (OR = 1.02;p= 0.049) showed a positive association. Genetic liability to depression (OR = 1.03;p= 0.001) elevated AD risk, and AD genetic risk increased susceptibility to delirium (OR = 1.32;p= 0.0005). Cardiovascular traits, including coronary artery disease (OR = 1.07;p= 0.021) and hypertension (OR = 4.30;p= 0.044), were causally linked to a higher AD risk. Other conditions, such as insomnia, chronic periodontitis, migraine, and certain cancers, exhibited significant genetic correlations. Intriguingly, herpes zoster (OR = 0.87;p= 0.005) and cataracts (OR = 0.96;p= 0.012) demonstrated inverse genetic associations with AD. These findings suggest potential therapeutic targets and preventive strategies, emphasizing the need to address comorbid systemic diseases to reduce AD risk and progression.

The gray matter of the higher brain undergoes spreading depolarization (SD) in response to the increased metabolic demand of ischemia, promoting acute neuronal injury and death following stroke, traumatic brain injury, or sudden cardiac arrest The mechanism linking ischemic failure of the Na+/K+ATPase (NKA) pump to the immediate onset of a large inward current driving SD has remained a mystery because blockade of conventional ion channels does not prevent SD nor ischemic neuron death. The marine poison palytoxin (PLTX) specifically binds the NKA at picomolar concentrations, converting this transporter to an open cationic channel, causing sudden neuronal Na+influx and K+efflux. This pump failure, together with induction of a strong inward current, should evoke SD-like activity in gray matter. Indeed, 1-10 nM PLTX applied to live coronal brain slices of rodents induces a propagating depolarization remarkably like SD induced by oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD). This PLTX depolarization (PD) mimicked other effects of OGD. In the neocortex, as an elevated light transmittance (LT) front passed by an extracellular pipette, a distinct negative DC shift indicated mass cell depolarization, whether induced by bath OGD or PLTX. Either treatment induced strong SD-like responses in the same higher or lower brain regions. Further, we imaged identical real-time OGD-SD or PD effects upon live pyramidal neurons using 2-photon microscopy. Taken together, these findings support our proposal that an endogenous PLTX-like molecule may open the NKA to conduct Na+influx/K+efflux, thereby driving SD and, in its wake, ensuing neuronal damage.

Chronic posttraumatic headache (CPTHA) is a prevalent condition following traumatic brain injury, especially among veterans, with a significant impact on quality of life. Traditional treatments often lack efficacy and evidence-based support.
We report the case of a 46-year-old male veteran with CPTHA, nonresponsive to standard therapies, including botulinum toxin A and oral medications. The patient underwent treatment with the gammaCore vagus nerve stimulator, a US Food and Drug Administration-cleared device intended for migraine and cluster headache management.
Following initiation of gammaCore therapy, the patient experienced a marked reduction in headache intensity and frequency, alongside significant improvements in anxiety levels. These outcomes suggest that gammaCore may be a promising noninvasive treatment option for CPTHA, particularly in patients with coexisting mood disorders. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and establish gammaCore's role in CPTHA management.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is defined by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels alongside normal free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels. Emerging evidence suggests a link between SCH and migraine disorders, including both episodic and chronic migraine. Given this association, researchers have explored whether correcting mild thyroid dysfunction with low-dose levothyroxine could alleviate migraine symptoms in affected individuals. This study investigates the potential efficacy of low-dose thyroid replacement therapy in reducing migraine frequency and severity among patients with comorbid SCH and migraine.
A search was conducted on Cochrane Central, Medline, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs), case-control studies, and cohort research studies evaluating the use of low-dose thyroxine in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH).
This review analyzed four studies, two of which qualified for meta-analysis. The findings suggest a potential association between (SCH) and migraine. Notably, levothyroxine treatment in hypothyroid patients appeared to correlate with reduced migraine frequency and headache severity. However, while the meta-analysis showed a trend toward migraine reduction with thyroxine therapy, the results did not reach statistical significance - likely due to the limited study sample included in the analysis.
The study highlights the importance of thyroid screening in migraine management, due to the link between hypothyroidism and migraines. It recommends routine thyroid function assessments for migraine patients and suggests personalized treatment approaches. Early intervention can minimize migraine episodes and improve quality of life. Adherence to low dose levothyroxine regimens can reduce migraine frequency. Further research is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, optimize treatment protocols, and explore potential comorbidities.

The phase 3 PREEMPT clinical trials confirmed the efficacy and safety of 155 U - 195 U onabotulinumtoxinA for individuals with chronic migraine (CM) and is the licensed dose in Canada and Europe. This analysis aimed to analyze the efficacy and safety parameters of 155 U - 195 U onabotulinumtoxinA in participants with CM from the real-world REPOSE study.
REPOSE (NCT01686581) was a 2-year, prospective, observational, noninterventional, open-label study that described the real-world use of onabotulinumtoxinA in adults with CM in Europe. Participants received onabotulinumtoxinA approximately every 12 weeks and were monitored for 24 months after starting treatment. Data on participant-estimated mean headache-day frequency in the last month (MHD), Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ) scores, and adverse events (AEs) were collected at each treatment visit. Participants in the safety analysis population (those who received at least one dose of onabotulinumtoxinA) were stratified into two groups based on the dosage received at four or more treatment visits: 155 U onabotulinumtoxinA and 156 U - 195 U onabotulinumtoxinA groups.
A total of 641 participants were enrolled at 77 centers. Of those, 218 participants received 155 U ≥ 4 treatment visits, and 77 participants received 156 U-195 U onabotulinumtoxinA ≥ 4 treatment visits. Between-group baseline characteristics were similar. Reductions from baseline in MHD frequency were observed at both doses (156 U - 195 U range, -8.7 to -14.2 MHDs; 155 U range, -8.2 to -11.9 MHDs). Mean change from baseline in MSQ domain scores improved across administration visits for both 155 U onabotulinumtoxinA and 156 U - 195 U onabotulinumtoxinA groups. Treatment with 156 U - 195 U onabotulinumtoxinA was safe and generally well-tolerated with no new safety signals identified. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) were reported in 51/218 in the 155 U group and 10/77 participants in the 156 U - 195 U group; serious adverse drug reactions were 3/218 and 1/77, respectively. The most frequently reported ADR across both dose groups was eyelid ptosis, followed by neck pain, musculoskeletal stiffness.
These real-world findings of the safety and efficacy of the 155 U - 195 U onabotulinumtoxinA doses are consistent with data from the PREEMPT clinical trials as a treatment option for CM patients.

In the sustainable development goals (SDG) context of seeking universal health coverage, the expanding gap between the supply of specialized and primary health-care providers of headache-related health care and the care needs of the very large number of people affected by headache is a formidable but not insoluble public-health challenge. Structured headache services provide a cost-effective framework wherein controlled patient flows enable the care needs of people with headache to be met at appropriate levels, but these services may still be overwhelmed by inappropriate demand.Community pharmacists are an underutilized resource, potentially well able to provide the solution. To do so, they must, as a profession, be integrated into structured headache services.What remains to be determined is how to achieve this integration in an encouraging climate for change, which recognises the potential for relieving strained health-care systems and meeting a range of health-care needs by expanding pharmacists' scope of practice.This position statement on behalf of the European Headache Federation (EHF) and Lifting The Burden (LTB) is formally endorsed by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP).

The exact mechanisms that trigger the activation of the trigeminovascular system in migraine remain unclear. The involvement of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in migraine is well-documented, and treatments aimed at blocking CGRP activity have proven successful in reducing migraine attacks for some patients. However, around one third of individuals do not respond to these therapies, which are also limited by factors like cost, side effects, and contraindications. There is growing evidence suggesting that glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, plays a crucial role in the onset and maintenance of migraine pain, partially by enhancing CGRP release. Increased glutamate levels have been linked to both peripheral and central sensitization, potentially contributing to the development and persistence of chronic migraine. The relationship between CGRP and glutamate is complex, with glutamate possibly acting as an upstream trigger for CGRP release. This review examines the interplay between CGRP and glutamate, and their involvement in both peripheral and central sensitization. It also explores the therapeutic potential of targeting either glutamate or CGRP, aiming to address both peripheral and central migraine mechanisms. Finally, the role of triggers in migraine initiation at the peripheral level is discussed, offering insights into potential preventive strategies.

Migraine is a leading cause of disability worldwide, significantly impacting quality of life and healthcare systems. Despite its high prevalence and burden, migraine remains underprioritized in global health policies. This study examines the epidemiological trends of migraine in Australia, China, Japan, and South Korea from 1990 to 2021, highlighting regional disparities and forecasting future burdens.
This study utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 to analyze incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) of migraine. Age-standardized rates (ASRs) were calculated to enable fair cross-country comparisons. Joinpoint regression analysis was applied to assess temporal trends, while Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) modeling was used to project future trends until 2050. Additionally, decomposition analysis was conducted to differentiate the effects of population aging, growth, and epidemiological changes.
In 2021, China had the highest migraine burden, with 13.05 million new cases and 184.75 million prevalent cases, followed by Australia, Japan, and South Korea. Incidence rates peaked in adolescence (10-14 years), while prevalence and disability were highest in middle-aged women (40-44 years). From 1990 to 2021, Australia exhibited stable trends, China experienced increasing burden, Japan saw a decline due to aging, and Korea exhibited mixed patterns influenced by opposing demographic and epidemiological forces. Future projections suggest a stable trend in Australia, declining incidence in China and Japan, and continued burden in Korea.
Migraine remains a significant public health challenge across all four countries, with age, gender, and demographic changes playing key roles in burden variations. The study highlights the need for region-specific healthcare strategies and age- and gender-sensitive interventions. Future research should explore socioeconomic, behavioral, and healthcare access factors to refine migraine management strategies.

The use of monoclonal antibodies targeting Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) is an established treatment for chronic migraine (CM). However, its efficacy in CM patients with medication overuse headache (MOH) remains underexplored, and data on the safety and patient compliance of standard-to-high doses, especially Eptinezumab and Erenumab, over at least three months are limited.
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-CGRP therapy (Eptinezumab and Erenumab) in CM and MOH patients. Specifically, it assesses changes in monthly migraine days (MMDs) after 12 weeks, risk of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to discontinuation, serious TEAEs, common adverse effects, and MOH remission at 6 months.
A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating standard or high dose anti-CGRP therapy in CM patients strictly with MOH. Studies included were required to report a ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs after ≥ 12 weeks, serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation, common adverse events, and MOH remission at 6 months. Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics and a random-effects model.
Three RCTs with 769 patients receiving standard-to-high dose anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (Eptinezumab and Erenumab) for ≥ 12 weeks were included. Anti-CGRP therapy significantly increased the likelihood of a ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs compared to placebo (OR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.68-3.51; p < 0.00001). No substantial differences were found in TEAEs leading to discontinuation, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, or serious TEAEs between the anti-CGRP and placebo groups. The likelihood of MOH remission was approximately double in the anti-CGRP group (OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.40-2.78; p = 0.0001).
Standard-to-high dose anti-CGRP therapies (eptinezumab, erenumab) effectively reduce monthly migraine days and improve MOH remission rates with minimal adverse effects, showing good tolerability in CM patients with MOH.

Migraine ranks as the second-leading cause of global neurological disability, affecting approximately 1.1 billion individuals worldwide with severe quality-of-life impairments. Although adjustable risk factors-including environmental exposures, sleep disturbances, and dietary patterns-are increasingly implicated in pathogenesis of migraine, their causal roles remain insufficiently characterized, and the integration of multimodal evidence lags behind epidemiological needs.
We developed a three-step analytical framework combining causal inference, predictive modeling, and burden projection to systematically evaluate modifiable factors associated with migraine. First, two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) assessed causality between five domains (metabolic profiles, body composition, cardiovascular markers, behavioral traits, and psychological states) and the risk of migraine. Second, we trained ensemble machine learning (ML) algorithms that incorporated these factors, with Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis quantifying predictor importance. Finally, spatiotemporal burden mapping synthesized global incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) data to project region-specific risk and burden trajectories through 2050.
MR analyses identified significant causal associations between multiple adjustable factors (including overweight, obesity class 2, type 2 diabetes [T2DM], hip circumference [HC], body mass index [BMI], myocardial infarction, and feeling miserable) and the risk of migraine (P < 0.05, FDR-q < 0.05). The Random Forest (RF)-based model achieved excellent discrimination (Area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.927), identifying gender, age, HC, waist circumference [WC], BMI, and systolic blood pressure [SBP] as the predictors. Burden mapping projected a global decline in migraine incidence by 2050, yet persistently high prevalence and DALYs burdens underscored the urgency of timely interventions to maximize health gains.
Integrating causal inference, predictive modeling, and burden projection, this study establishes hierarchical evidence for adjustable migraine determinants and translates findings into scalable prevention frameworks. These findings bridge the gap between biological mechanisms, clinical practice, and public health policy, providing a tripartite framework that harmonizes causal inference, individualized risk prediction, and global burden mapping for migraine prevention.

Resistance to treatments have been assessed in chronic conditions such as migraine, but not in temporomandibular disorders (TMD). This study aimed to identify factors that influence treatment outcome in patients with myofascial TMD pain.
Seventy-two females were divided into three groups: TMD successfully treated (TMD-S, n = 24), TMD resistant to treatment (TMD-R, n = 24) and Controls without TMD (n = 24). Criteria for resistance included: less than 30% pain reduction after three months of conservative treatment and an average pain intensity > 50 mm (VAS) during the last month. Quantitative sensory testing (QST), psychosocial status and genetic polymorphisms were examined. ANOVA on ranks (psychosocial variables) with Dunn's test as post-hoc or ANOVA (age and somatosensory variables) with Tukey test as post-hoc test, and Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner test (genetic variables) were used for univariate groups comparisons. Multivariate statistics were used to identify outcomes that separated the groups.
QST assessment revealed lower baseline pressure pain threshold and higher wind-up ratio in the trigeminally and spinally innervated areas in the TMD-R group compared with the other groups (p = 0.01). Also, the TMD-R group presented higher values in all assessed psychosocial variables (p < 0.01) and higher prevalence of the HTR1A polymorphism rs6295 (p = 0.02) compared with the other groups at baseline. Multivariate analysis showed that the three variables that distinguished the best between TMD-R and TMD-S were sleeping quality, central sensitization, and depressive symptoms.
Psychosocial, somatosensory, and genetic alterations are related to unsuccessful treatment response in myofascial TMD patients.

Migraine is a common comorbidity with fibromyalgia (FM). CGRP is a potent inflammatory neuropeptide that may play a role in somatic and visceral pain either inflammatory or neuropathic. Previous studies have reported a significant number of migraine patients with FM responding to anti-CGRP therapies. The potential impact on diffuse pain and global disability associated with fibromyalgia is still unclear. In this retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study, we aimed to analyze the effects of a monoclonal antibody therapy in a subpopulation of migraineurs with FM compared to patients without this comorbidity by assessing the headache frequency and disability as well as the severity of FM (assessed by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ).
Among 1088 patients came for the first visit to our headache Center between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2022, we examined six-month outcomes of 148 migraine patients prescribed various monoclonal antibodies to CGRP, erenumab, galcanezumab, and fremanezumab. One hundred and twenty-two patients were selected, 26 of whom suffered from FM. We retrospectively evaluated the following characteristics at baseline (T0) and after 6 months (T1),headache frequency and severity, number of days with symptomatic medication, and MIDAS score. In the FM patients, we evaluated the FIQ and the intensity of somatic pain using a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10.
Headache characteristics improved similarly in patients with and without FM comorbidity. The number of patients in whom headache frequency decreased by at least 50% was similar in the two migraine groups. In patients with FM, both fibromyalgia-related disability and somatic pain improved. The improvement in fibromyalgia disability was significantly correlated with the improvement in migraine-related disability.
We found that in migraine suffereres with FM, anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies had a similar beneficial effect on migraine as in non-fibromyalgia patients, in addition to reducing somatic pain and global disability from the disease. The anti-CGRP agents, represent a good option for the treatment of migraineurs with fibromyalgia, for which no resolutive therapy is yet available.

Although neuroinflammation may play a key role in the pathology of migraine and its progression to chronic migraine (CM), its specific involvement-particularly the role of microglia- remains unclear. We investigated whether neuroinflammation is involved in the pathophysiology of CM and whether pro-inflammatory signals are associated with its clinical features.
Nineteen individuals with CM and 10 healthy controls (HCs) underwent integrated brain positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) using the translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand ([11C] PBR28, a marker of glial activation, together with the quantification of blood plasma inflammatory cytokine/chemokine. Volumes in regions of interest (ROI) were calculated based on MRI data and the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) for [11C] PBR28 was extracted for each ROI. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between [11C] PBR28 SUVR and changes in plasma factors was calculated.
CM patients had a significantly higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) scores than that in HCs (p < 0.05). Participants with CM also exhibited reduced volume in the thalamus (p = 0.012), compared with HCs. Moreover [11C] PBR28 binding was increased in the midbrain, occipital lobe and vermis, along with increased interictal plasma interleukin-8 (IL-8) and CX3CL1 levels, in individuals with CM compared with HCs. Notably, the midbrain levels of TSPO were negatively correlated with the headache frequency (r=-0.462, p = 0.046).
These findings demonstrate increased central inflammation in CM participants compared to HCs, providing imaging evidence for the potential involvement of neuroinflammation in CM pathophysiology. Additionally, the observed reduction in thalamic volume may contribute to the chronification of migraine.

Propranolol is a beta-blocker psychoactive drug used for the management of high blood pressure, tremors, atrial fibrillation, and migraine headaches. This study investigated the effect of propranolol on behavior, acetylcholinesterase, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase in the brain of African Sharptooth Catfish Clarias gariepinus juveniles.
A total of 180 African Sharptooth Catfish were exposed to 7.00-, 9.00-, 11.00-, 13.00-, and 15.00-mg/L acute propranolol concentrations and a control (0.00 mg/L) for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, and the 96-h LC50 value was 9.48 mg/L. For sublethal study, 120 juvenile African Sharptooth Catfish were divided into four groups of 30 fish each and exposed to 1.90-, 0.95-, and 0.47-mg/L propranolol concentrations and a control for 21 d and allowed to recover for 7 d. All the treatment groups and control were set in triplicates, with 10 fish in each. The behavioral changes due to propranolol exposure were monitored by direct observation and scoring during the exposure and withdrawal period. The brains of fish were sampled every week for 4 weeks in order to evaluate the effects of propranolol on acetylcholinesterase, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress parameters.
Behavioral changes were evidenced by alterations in swimming rates, air gulping activities, and opercula beats in the propranolol-exposed fish during the acute exposure. Sublethal exposure resulted in a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase and catalase but increase in glutathione peroxidase and reductase values. Significant increase in lipid peroxidation and acetylcholinesterase enzyme levels were observed as exposure duration increased from day 7 compared with the control. The effects of propranolol on the observed parameters appeared to wane after fish withdrawal from the drug for 7 d.
The drug propranolol, as demonstrated by these alterations, may negatively impact nontarget aquatic species and may have ecological consequences.
Exposure of African Sharptooth Catfish to propranolol resulted in behavioral changes, a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase and catalase, and an increase in glutathione peroxidase and reductase values. Significant increase in lipid peroxidation and acetylcholinesterase enzyme levels were observed as exposure duration increased from day 7 compared with the control. The effects of propranolol on the observed parameters appeared to wane after fish withdrawal from the drug for 7 d. Propranolol may negatively impact nontarget aquatic species and may have ecological consequences.

Strong evidence suggested the presence of abnormal cortical processing of pain in patients with migraine during and in between the attacks. The aim of this work was to assess the possible alterations in cortical excitability in patients with migraine in between the attacks using middle latency somatosensory evoked potential. The second objective was to study the relationship between cortical excitability in patients with migraine, and severity, frequency, and duration of migraine headache attacks.
This case-control study was conducted on 40 migraine patients and 40 age and sex matched healthy controls. Severity of migraine was assessed using Migraine Severity Scale (MIGSEV), Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The peak latencies and amplitudes of the middle latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were measured for patients and controls.
There was a statistically significant difference between Migraine patients and controls regarding middle latency SSEPs variables. There was no statistically significant correlation between middle latency SSEPs variables in patients with migraine and either age, body mass index (BMI), disease duration, monthly migraine days, duration of migraine headache attacks, MIGSEV, HIT-6, or VAS.
Patients with migraine have a significantly higher cortical excitability in comparison to controls. No significant relationship between cortical excitability in patients with migraine and either severity, frequency, or duration of migraine headache attacks.
