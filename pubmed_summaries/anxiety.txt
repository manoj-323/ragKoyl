This study examines the relationship between exposure to climate change news and eco-anxiety in the Chinese general population, exploring the moderating effects of first-person effect (FPE) and third-person effect (TPE).
Utilizing a non-representative sample of 1483 Chinese adults, we conducted an online survey assessing media consumption across traditional and digital platforms, FPE, TPE, and eco-anxiety. The survey included structured items measuring the frequency and impact of climate change news exposure, alongside scales for assessing eco-anxiety and perceptual biases (FPE and TPE).
Preliminary analyses indicate a significant correlation between higher exposure to climate change news and increased levels of eco-anxiety. Moderation analysis revealed that both FPE and TPE significantly influenced the relationship between news exposure and eco-anxiety, with FPE strengthening and TPE weakening this association.
The findings suggest that the way individuals perceive the impact of climate change news-on themselves versus others-moderates the emotional response to such news. Specifically, those who perceive a greater personal impact (FPE) experience higher eco-anxiety, whereas those who perceive a greater impact on others (TPE) report lower anxiety levels. This study highlights the need for nuanced media communication strategies that consider these perceptual biases to manage public emotional responses to climate change effectively.

Cocaine and methamphetamine use disorders (CcUD/MtUD) have serious public health, medical, and psychiatric consequences. Yet, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments available. The STIMULUS study is a multi-site trial, sponsored by the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), that aims to investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a potential treatment for moderate to severe CcUD/MtUD.
The study is a double-blind, sham-controlled trial seeking to recruit 160 participants with a current moderate to severe CcUD or MtUD diagnosis, randomized to receive active rTMS (10-Hz stimulation at 120% motor threshold over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) or sham. Feasibility is assessed by a target of at least 20 treatment sessions administered within an 8-week period. Additionally, the study aims to evaluate the efficacy of rTMS in reducing stimulant use and craving, the impact of rTMS on mood, anxiety, sleep, and other measures, and the utility of electroencephalography as a treatment response biomarker.
Studies exploring rTMS for stimulant use disorders remain limited by small sample sizes, as well as great heterogeneity in defined study population, treatment parameters, retention in treatment, and number of sessions. In this paper, we highlight key study design decisions, such as safety, sham procedure, and schedule flexibility.
We hope that the data collected will lay the groundwork for a robust randomized controlled trial of rTMS as a therapeutic intervention for individuals with CcUD/MtUD.

Health care workers (HCWs) face significant mental health challenges when delivering care and over the span of their careers. Despite growing recognition of these issues, barriers such as stigma, structural limitations, and individual obstacles continue to impede progress in supporting HCWs mental health needs. Digital mental health platforms continue to expand in health systems as they offer novel approaches to address these gaps, but more evidence is needed to understand their reception among HCWs.
To examine the perceptions of HCWs regarding their mental health, explore barriers and facilitators to accessing mental health care, and assess their experiences with digital mental health interventions within the context of the pandemic.
A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with HCWs who participated in a prior randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the impact of a digital mental health platform on anxiety and depression.
A large, urban, academic health system.
A purposive sample of 64 HCWs, including physicians, nurses, technicians, administrative staff, and social workers, was recruited. Participants were selected from the upper and lower quartiles of anxiety and depression scores from the parent RCT to capture a range of mental health symptomatology.
The study aimed to identify HCWs' attitudes toward mental health care, barriers to utilizing professional resources, and their experiences with the digital mental health platform at the local institution. A thematic content analysis was used to analyze the interview data.
Five major themes were identified: (1) the evolving mental health challenges during and after the pandemic, (2) individual barriers to accessing care, such as personal coping strategies and familial responsibilities, (3) structural barriers like workload and limited access to mental health clinicians, (4) experiences with digital mental health interventions, including text message-based assessments, and (5) recommendations for future digital health strategies to improve access and reduce stigma.
Digital mental health interventions provide a promising avenue to support HCWs by reducing stigma and improving access to mental health resources and clinicians. However, personalized and system-level changes are necessary to address the ongoing mental health challenges faced by the workforce.

Recurrent aphthous ulcer (RAU) is the most prevalent oral mucosal disease, yet its etiology remains unclear. Anxiety and depression have been linked to the onset of RAU, but research findings were contradictory. The association of intestinal diseases with RAU implies a potential role of gut microbiota in the development of this condition. This study aims to explore the correlation between the presence and severity of RAU and psychological factors, as well as gut microbiota dysbiosis.
The Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), Zung's self-rating depression scale (SDS), and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) were used to assess the participants' psychological status. The lactulose hydrogen-methane breath test was performed to detect the presence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in RAU patients. The long-term severity of RAU is quantified using the monthly number of ulcers. Compare the differences in outcomes between individuals with RAU and the healthy population, and explore the factors influencing the severity of RAU.
Forty-nine patients and 49 controls were included. The RAU group had significantly higher SAS scores (t = 2.18, p = 0.034), and SIBO positivity (χ2= 75.67, p < 0.001). Factors correlated with the monthly number of ulcers included SAS score (r = 0.52, p < 0.001), symptoms of anxiety (r = 0.42, p = 0.004), SDS score (r = 0.46, p = 0.002), PSQI score (r = 0.35, p = 0.020), and SIBO positivity (r = 0.42, p = 0.005). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that anxiety and SIBO may influence the severity of RAU. Moreover, SAS score (r = 0.38, p = 0.010) and SDS score (r = 0.38, p = 0.009) exhibited correlations with SIBO.
RAU patients are at a higher risk of anxiety and gut microbiota dysbiosis, which could potentially escalate the severity of RAU. The role of the brain-gut axis in the pathogenesis of RAU warrants further exploration.

Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic condition with complex symptoms, including pelvic pain and urinary frequency. Current treatments often involve a combination of therapies, but their effectiveness remains a topic of ongoing investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a treatment regimen combining intravesical instillation of heparin and alkalized lidocaine, hydrodistention, and transurethral fulguration, using pelvic ultrasound monitoring and symptom scales to assess patient outcomes.
From June 2016 to June 2023, patients who were diagnosed as interstitial cystitis in urology department of the xuzhou central hospital were selected. All patients received intravesical instillation regimen of 2% lidocaine 10 ml + 5% sodium bicarbonate 5 ml + heparin 25000 IU for 6 months, and they were randomly divided into two groups according to the simple randomization (coin toss): hydrodistention and transurethral fulguration (HD/TF) group and non-HD/TF group. The 24-h urination frequency, nocturia frequency, pelvic ultrasound measurement results (bladder volume at maximum filling state, bladder wall thickness after urination, residual urine volume), O'Leary-Sant interstitial cystitis symptom index (ICSI), O'Leary-Sant interstitial cystitis problem index (ICPI), pelvic pain and urgency/frequency (PUF), pain visual analogue score (VAS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) were recorded before treatment and 3 and 6 months after treatment.
A total of 68 patients were included in this study, including 13 males (19.12%) and 55 females (80.88%), with an average age of 59.07 ± 8.15 years. According to the simple randomization, 68 patients were randomly divided into HD/TF group (n = 30) and non-HD/TF group (n = 38). After the 3rd and 6 th months of treatment, the 24-h urination frequency and nocturia frequency in both groups decreased significantly (P < 0.05), and the 24-h urination frequency and nocturia frequency after the 3rd and 6 th months of treatment in HD/TF group decreased significantly compared with that in non-HD/TF group (P < 0.05). After the 3rd and 6 th months of treatment, the bladder volume at maximum filling state in the two groups increased and the residual urine volume decreased (P < 0.05). In addition, the bladder volume at maximum filling state of the HD/TF group increased significantly compared to the non-HD/TF group after 3rd and 6 th months of treatment (P < 0.05), while the bladder wall thickness after urination decreased compared to the non-HD/TF group after 3rd months of treatment (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in residual urine volume between HD/TF group and non-HD/TF group before and after treatment (P > 0.05). The postoperative scores at 3rd and 6 th months of ICPI, ICSI, PUF, SAS and VAS in both groups were significantly lower than those before treatment (P < 0.05), and The postoperative scores at 3rd and 6 th months of ICPI, ICSI, PUF, SAS and VAS in HD/TF group were significantly lower than those in non-HD/TF group (P < 0.05).
Intravesical instillation of heparin/alkalized lidocaine combined with hydrodistention and transurethral fulguration is an effective treatment for interstitial cystitis, which can significantly reduce patient pain and improve patient prognosis. Moreover, the use of pelvic ultrasound to monitor indicators such as bladder volume at maximum filling state and residual urine volume, combined with ICSI, ICPI, PUF, VAS, and SAS scores, has high application value for evaluating the efficacy of intravesical instillation regimen combined with hydrodistention and transurethral fulguration in the treatment of interstitial cystitis.

Effective patient education is critical in enhancing treatment outcomes and reducing anxiety in dental procedures. This study compares the effectiveness of AI-generated educational materials with traditional methods in improving patient comprehension and reducing anxiety during endodontic and restorative dental treatments.
A cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted with 100 participants undergoing restorative or endodontic procedures. Patients were randomized into two groups: those receiving AI-generated instructional materials (via ChatGPT) and those receiving traditional education (verbal explanations and pamphlets). Baseline knowledge and post-intervention knowledge retention were assessed using structured tests. Patient perceptions of clarity, usefulness, comprehensiveness, trust, and anxiety were measured using Likert-scale surveys. Three dental experts evaluated the educational content for accuracy and suitability. Statistical analysis included t-tests and Cohen's kappa to measure inter-rater reliability.
AI-generated materials significantly outperformed traditional methods in all measured dimensions, including clarity (4.42 vs. 3.25), usefulness (4.63 vs. 3.50), comprehensiveness (4.50 vs. 3.29), trust (4.00 vs. 2.96), and anxiety reduction (mean anxiety score: 2.63 vs. 3.38, p < 0.001). Pre- and post-intervention knowledge assessments revealed substantial knowledge improvement in the AI group. Expert evaluations confirmed the accuracy and suitability of AI-generated materials, with high inter-rater reliability (κ = 0.75, p < 0.001).
AI-generated educational materials demonstrate superior effectiveness in improving patient comprehension and reducing anxiety compared to traditional methods. Their integration into dental practice could enhance patient satisfaction and streamline the educational process, particularly for complex or anxiety-inducing procedures. Future research should explore their application in diverse dental specialties and assess long-term impacts on patient behavior and clinical outcomes.

Evaluating health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in the general population is essential for establishing benchmarks for health outcome assessments. This study aimed to generate population norms for the EQ-5D-5L dimensions, EQ-VAS (EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale) scores, and EQ-5D-5L index scores in Iran, stratified by sex and age.
Data for this cross-sectional study were gathered through face-to-face interviews with 3,518 adults from the general population across nine provinces in Iran, employing a multistage sampling approach. Respondents assessed their own health state across the EQ-5D-5L dimensions-mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression-along with the EQ-VAS to evaluate their overall health. The EQ-5D-5L score was calculated using the value set derived from the Iranian general population. Dimension scores and index values (EQ-5D-5L index and EQ-VAS score) were analyzed using multiple logistic regression and generalized linear model (GLM), respectively.
The estimated mean ± standard deviation [SD] of EQ-5D-5L index for the general population of Iran was 0.789 ± 0.258, while the EQ-VAS score was estimated at 74.34 ± 18.67. Among the study participants, 35.8% reported being in the best health state (11111), while the remaining 64.2% experienced problems in at least one of the five dimensions. The most commonly reported problems were related to anxiety/depression (49.2%), followed by pain/discomfort (45.3%). Regression analyses revealed that females reported significantly more problems across the five dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L and had lower EQ-5D-5L index and EQ-VAS scores compared to males. Anxiety/depression were more prevalent among younger individuals, while problems in other dimensions tended to increase with age.
The findings indicate that nearly two-thirds of respondents experienced problems in at least one dimension, with anxiety/depression being the most prevalent, particularly among younger individuals. Females reported lower utility scores and more problems across all dimensions in all age groups. To effectively improve the health status of the Iranian population and ensure optimal resource allocation, it is vital to develop and implement targeted interventions that specifically address the needs highlighted in this study.

Little is known about the mental health consequences of large-scale industrial fires without fatalities but with persistent odors for several months. One such fire occurred in 2019 in Rouen, France. This survey aimed to assess the impact of the fire on the mental health of the exposed population fifteen months later.
A random representative stratified sample was selected from the exposed population in Rouen and a non-exposed population in a nearby city. Three probable mental health disorders were assessed with self-administered psychometric scales: PCL-5 for probable post-traumatic stress disorder, GAD-7 for probable generalized anxiety, and PHQ-9 for probable depression. Different types of exposure were self-reported: perceived odors, black smoke, visual or auditory fire perception, soot deposits, or fibrocement roof debris. The prevalence of probable mental health disorders and the associated factors were examined.
A total of 1,968 people participated (overall response rate of 20%). In the exposed area, 6% (5-7%) of people presented probable post-traumatic stress disorder attributable to the fire, 15% (13-17%) probable generalized anxiety, and 18% (16-20%) probable depression. The prevalence of all three was significantly higher in participants living close to the fire. Probable post-traumatic stress disorder and probable generalized anxiety were both associated with auditory perception of the fire or explosions. Probable generalized anxiety was also associated with the duration of exposure to unpleasant odors. Probable depression was associated with the duration of exposure to odors, and the presence of fibrocement roof debris.
Even though there were no fatalities and no injured people, the industrial fire had a mental health impact on people living in the exposed area in the medium term. The results of this work were used to implement further adequate medico-psychological care for the exposed population.

The purpose of this study was to explore caregiver burden and its influencing factors in cancer patients undergoing palliative PTBD from both caregiver and patient perspectives.
A cross-sectional study was conducted on caregiver-patient dyads who underwent palliative percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) from January to December 2023 at a tertiary hospital in western China. The Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI), the Chinese version of the Family Resilience Assessment Scale (FRAS), the Self-Perceived Burden Scale (SPBS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were used to assess outcome variables. Sociodemographic data and PTBD-related characteristics were also collected. Multiple linear regression was conducted to identify the influencing factors of caregiver burden.
A total of 185 caregiver-patient dyads were included in this study. The participants had a mean age of 51.6 years, and 68.6% were female. The median ZBI score was 58.7, with 47.5% of caregivers experiencing severe burden. Caregivers' daily time spent on caregiving, anxiety (β = 1.20, p = 0.001), depression (β = 0.86, p = 0.009), and family resilience (β = -0.11, p = 0.016) were found to be influencing factors of caregiver burden. Additionally, patient age (β = 0.20, p < 0.001), female sex (β = 3.61, p = 0.010), having more than one tube (β = 4.22, p = 0.003), and the tube maintenance institution were identified as influencing factors of caregiver burden.
Caregivers of cancer patients undergoing palliative PTBD had a considerable burden, which was influenced by factors from both the caregiver and patient perspectives. It is imperative for healthcare providers to develop interventions that target the modifiable influencing factors identified to support these caregivers effectively.

This pre-registered (#CRD42024509947) systematic review synthesized evidence on cognitive behavioral interventions (CBTs) for youths with school attendance problems (SAPs). The PsycINFO, PubMed, ERIC, and Scopus databases were searched through 1985-2024 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, and open trials (OTs) evaluating SAP-focused CBT. Data were synthesized narratively and through meta-analysis. Four RCTs and eleven OTs met eligibility criteria, including 932 youths. Meta-analyses revealed small to large uncontrolled pre- to post-intervention effects for school attendance (g = 1.02), anxiety (g = - 0.57), depression (g = - 0.66), and behavioral problems (g = - 0.40), which were maintained at follow-up. When compared to a control, CBT had a medium effect on school attendance (g = 0.44) but non-significant effects on anxiety (g = - 0.09) and depression (g = - 0.14). While the results hold promise for SAP-focused CBTs, evidence was limited by study heterogeneity, bias risks, methodological limitations, and inconsistent outcome measures, highlighting the needed for further RCTs.

This study examines disparities in self-reported HRQoL among English-speaking non-Latinx White, English-speaking Latinx, and Spanish-speaking Latinx children ages 4-12 years undergoing surgery.
A total of 357 children completed the Child Health Rating Inventories, an animated, computer-administered method, to measure overall, physical, and mental health, as well as pre-operative anxiety. A multivariate general linear model was used to analyze the main effects of race/ethnicity and language on self-reported HRQoL.
Results demonstrated differences in child self-reported overall [F(2,311) = 3.11, p = 0.05)] and mental health F(2,311) = 3.56, p = 0.03)], and preoperative anxiety F(2,311) = 5.70, p = 0.004)] by race/ethnicity and language. Post hoc comparisons using the Bonferroni test indicated that English-speaking Latinx children reported significantly poorer overall (p = 0.04) and mental health (p = 0.04) compared to English-speaking non-Latinx children. English-speaking and Spanish-speaking Latinx children reported significantly higher preoperative anxiety (p = 0.004 and p = 0.02, respectively) compared to English-speaking non-Latinx White children.
Latinx children from English-speaking households as young as 4 years old reported their overall and mental health to be poorer compared to Non-Latinx White children from English-speaking households. Latinx children, regardless of spoken language, reported higher preoperative anxiety compared to non-Latinx White children. These findings highlight the need to consider early childhood experiences in understanding health disparities. Factors such as family dynamics, acculturative stress, and access to healthcare resources could potentially account for disparities in young children's health experiences.

Although distal (i.e., discrimination, victimization, rejection, and nonaffirmation) and proximal (i.e., internalized transphobia, negative expectations, and identity nondisclosure) gender minority stressors are associated with internalizing (i.e., depression, anxiety, suicidality) and externalizing (i.e., substance use) mental health outcomes of trans individuals, how they are related to two distinct types of outcomes differs. General psychological processes (i.e., hopelessness) could explain the mechanisms behind the minority stressors-mental health association. Accordingly, this study aimed to test the complete gender minority stress model and the direct and indirect effects of minority stressors via hopelessness on mental health outcomes in trans individuals. Data were collected online from a convenience sample of 205 trans adults (18-74 years; M = 29.49, SD = 10.24), 72 (35.1%) of whom were trans men, 52 (25.4%) were trans women, and 81 (39.5%) were non-binary individuals. Results from structural equation modeling showed that distal stressors directly predicted mental health outcomes, except for depression. Internalized transphobia and negative expectations had positive indirect effects on depression, anxiety, and past-year and lifetime suicidality via hopelessness. Identity nondisclosure had negative indirect effects on depression, anxiety, and past-year suicidality through hopelessness. For substance use, hopelessness was not a significant mediator. Still, identity nondisclosure mediated distal stressors-substance use link. Findings suggest that hopelessness is a significant contributor to internalizing symptoms of trans individuals, making it a target for interventions to improve the mental health of trans people. The ameliorative impact of identity nondisclosure on both types of mental health outcomes should be considered and examined in further studies.

Negative life events have been associated with the development of negative emotions, few studies have examined the chain mediating effect between negative life events and negative emotions among college students. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between negative life events and negative emotions in college students, as well as the chain mediating roles of social phobia and insomnia. A total of 8050 college students in three colleges in Anhui Province were selected through stratified cluster sampling method. Baseline data were collected in 2021 and followed up 6 months later. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the two. Bootstrapping procedure was used to test for mediating effects. Spearman correlation analysis showed that negative life events were significantly positively correlated with social phobia, insomnia, stress, depression and anxiety (r = 0.388, 0.319, 0.448, 0.449, 0.441). Among college students, the mediating effects of social phobia between negative life events and stress, depression, anxiety were 35.36%, 36.81%, and 37.27%, respectively. Meanwhile, the mediating effects of insomnia between negative life events and stress, depression, anxiety were 10.50%, 9.82% and 9.94%, respectively. The chain mediating effects of social phobia and insomnia between negative life events and stress, depression, anxiety were 3.31%, 3.07%, and 3.11%, in college students, respectively. These results indicate that negative life events can indirectly predict negative emotions, not only through the single mediating effect of social phobia and insomnia but also through the chain mediating effect of social phobia and insomnia.

The hippocampus1-6, as well as dopamine circuits7-9, coordinates decision-making in anxiety-eliciting situations. Yet, little is known about how dopamine modulates hippocampal representations of emotionally salient stimuli to inform appropriate resolution of approach versus avoidance conflicts. Here we studied dopaminoceptive neurons in the male mouse ventral hippocampus (vHipp), molecularly distinguished by their expression of dopamine D1 or D2 receptors. We show that these neurons are transcriptionally distinct and topographically organized across vHipp subfields and cell types. In the ventral subiculum where they are enriched, both D1 and D2 neurons are recruited during anxiogenic exploration, yet with distinct profiles related to investigation and behavioural selection. In turn, they mediate opposite approach-avoidance responses, and are differentially modulated by dopaminergic transmission in that region. Together, these results suggest that vHipp dopamine dynamics gate exploratory behaviours under contextual uncertainty, implicating dopaminoception in the complex computation engaged in the vHipp to govern emotional states.

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly challenged mental health of populations worldwide. We aimed to assess changes in mental health of cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults with pre-existing subclinical depressive symptoms during pandemic-related confinements, and the factors that could modulate these changes. CU older adults with (DepS, n = 53) and without (NoDepS, n = 47) pre-existing subclinical depressive symptoms (defined using the Geriatric Depression Scale at baseline) from the Age-Well randomized controlled trial (NCT02977819) were included - for whom data at baseline, post-intervention visits and during the two national confinements were available. The 18-month meditation or non-native language training intervention was completed before the pandemic. DepS, compared to NoDepS, had higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms at all assessments, including confinements. DepS had a greater increase in anxiety than NoDepS between the two confinements, and this increase was associated with greater ruminative brooding at baseline, but was not moderated by the meditation training intervention or by meditation practice during confinements. Pre-existing subclinical depressive symptoms in older adults contribute to mental health deterioration during confinements, with rumination being the main factor involved - stressing the need to treat these symptoms.

The serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and the serotonin autoreceptor (HTR1A) are two of the most extensively studied genes in the field of psychiatry, and their variants have been implicated in antidepressant response, specifically with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) which are widely regarded as the first-line medications for depression and anxiety. Variants of SLC6A4 and HTR1A have also been studied as risk factors for depression. In this retrospective study, we aim to investigate the relationship between all possible serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and autoreceptor (HTR1A) variant expression combinations that may have contributed to the therapeutic failure of an SSRI and subsequent disability. In this study, we utilize data from a cohort of 302 European patients diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety who were referred to Personalized Prescribing Inc. (PPI) in 2022 as result of a mental health disability claim to determine whether statistical differences are present in this cohort as compared to general European population allele frequencies. Our data reveals the presence and relevance of significant differences in the presentation of SLC6A4 and HTR1A, specifically in a disability cohort, relative to the average European population. The SLC6A4 gene codes for the serotonin transporter; the SSRI drug target that aims to be blocked to prevent the recycling of serotonin, whereas the HTR1A plays an indirect role as an autoreceptor allowing serotonin levels to be maintained by the SSRI, as well as a direct role in modulating mood through post-synaptic serotonin interaction. This study has revealed statistically significant differences in the expression of these two genes together in increasing the likelihood of drug failure, specifically the presence of one or more G alleles at HTR1A rs6295 in combination with the SLC6A4 SS variant. The most significantly overrepresented combination in this cohort of patients suffering from depression and anxiety that have failed to achieve adequate symptom remission on previous SSRI trials is HTR1A rs6295 GG-SLC6A4 SS which is overrepresented in this study by over 74% at a p-value well below 0.01. Genotyping anti-depressant drug targets may play an important role in optimizing anti-depressant drug response and research developments for future therapies.

To assess exploratorily the safety and efficacy of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) as an adjunctive therapy in improving symptoms in patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1). The TARGET-NT1 trial, a two-arm, double-blinded, sham-controlled trial was conducted from April 2022, to June 2024 ​at Xijing Hospital in Xi'an, China. Participants were randomised to receive tVNS treatment or sham tVNS (stVNS) treatment. Both interventions were performed for two 30-min periods per day with the same stimulation parameters but different stimulation points, for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in mean sleep onset latency of maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) from baseline to week 12. Secondary outcomes included changes in Narcolepsy Severity Scale (NSS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA-14), 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17). Among 60 randomised participants (32 men [53.3 ​%] and 28 [46.7 ​%]; mean [SD] age, 29.9 [9.9] years), 56 were included in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis. From baseline to week 12, the difference in mean change in mean sleep onset latency of MWT was 3.09 (95 ​% CI, 1.00, 5.88; P ​= ​0.0041) as compared with stVNS group. Significant improvements in NSS-EDS (-2.61 [95%CI, -4.07, -1.15; P ​= ​0.0006]), NSS-SP (-1.11 [95%CI, -1.83, -0.38; P ​= ​0.0030]), NSS-HH (-2.71 [95%CI, -3.36, -2.05; P ​< ​0.0001]), NSS- DNS (-0.52 [95%CI, -0.87, -0.17; P ​= ​0.0036]), ESS (-3.03 [95%CI, -4.30, -1.75; P ​< ​0.0001]) and HAMD-17 (-2.50 [95%CI, -4.30, -0.70; P ​= ​0.0069]) were observed in the tVNS group as compared with stVNS group. This exploratory study supported the efficacy and safety of tVNS in patients with NT1 and provided insights into the mechanisms underlying tVNS treatment for NT1. The findings highlight tVNS as a potential non-pharmacological adjunctive therapy for patients with NT1. This trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2400094550.

This study aimed to apply stress-diathesis model to investigate the prevalence of suicide attempts and associated factors in a nationally representative sample of adolescents.
A cross-sectional design and secondary data analysis were conducted using the parent study "Taiwan Youth Health Survey" data. A total of 5511 junior high school students were included. The outcome variable was self-reported suicide attempts, and the independent variables included self-reported stress and diathesis factors.
The prevalence of suicide attempts among adolescents was 7.7 %, with rates of 6.1 % for boys and 9.4 % for girls. The multiple logistic regression revealed that girls, loneliness, suicide ideation and plans, smoking, drinking alcohol, consumption of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs), eating fast food, experiencing a severe injury, being bullied, and lacking close friends were associated with an increased risk for attempting suicide. For boys, anxiety, smoking, experiencing severe injuries were identified as significant risk factors. For girls, loneliness, drinking alcohol, consuming CSDs, eating fast food, being bullied, and less parental supervision were identified as significant risk factors. The derived prediction score for the total group, boys, and girls yielded areas under the cure of 0.85, 0.82, and 0.87, respectively. The regression model, which incorporated interaction terms, demonstrated that loneliness, consumption of CSDs, and less parental supervision are gender-specific risk factors.
It is essential to consider gender differences in preventive measures. Appropriate interventions should be tailored to address both predispositions and stress unique to each gender, ensuring that gender-specific risk factors are managed more comprehensively.

Increasing demand and crowding in emergency departments (EDs) remain persistent challenges for healthcare systems worldwide. A portion of these visits is avoidable, indicating they could have been effectively managed in non-ED care settings. There has been increased attention on paramedics redirecting avoidable visits to community-based care before ED transport. However, limited evidence exists to identify which patients might be suitable for non-ED care models, particularly based on prehospital clinical presentations. This study aimed to examine the patient characteristics associated with avoidable and potentially avoidable ED visits prior to ED transport.
We conducted a cohort study using linked data from Hamilton Paramedic Services and a Canadian academic hospital between January 2022 and January 2024. ED visit records were classified using the Emergency Department Avoidability Classification into three classes: avoidable, potentially avoidable and not avoidable, and matched with their paramedic care reports. We used Firth's binary logistic regression to identify primary concerns associated with avoidable or potentially avoidable ED visits, reported as ORs with 95% CIs controlling for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate of 0.10.
Among the 23 891 ED visits analysed, 4.9% were classified as avoidable, 16.8% as potentially avoidable and 21.7% as either avoidable or potentially avoidable. Patients were primarily young-to-middle aged, presenting with a low medical acuity, taking fewer prescribed medications regularly and having stable vital signs within normal ranges. Primary concerns associated with these ED transports included social problems (OR 16.7, 4.5-95.5), anxiety (OR 15.0, 4.0-75.1), cough or congestion (OR 12.5, 3.2-65.4), lacerations (OR 11.0, 3.3-62.0) and minor problems (OR 7.8, 2.2-39.3).
Our findings highlight key patient characteristics and primary concerns that could inform paramedics to identify patients suitable for non-ED care models. Incorporating evidence-based criteria into paramedic decision-making could support the safe and effective implementation of alternative care models, which could potentially reduce ED visitation and promote optimal healthcare resource distribution.
